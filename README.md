# Tourist_TSP
Application that solves traveling salesman problem using genetic algorithm and is used for tourism purposes.

The theme of this paper is the implementation of a genetic algorithm in an application that solves the problem of a traveling salesman. 
The problem for the traveling salesman is the problem of finding the optimal route and returning to the point of origin. 
Since this problem belongs to the category of NP-difficult problems and is of factorial complexity, it does not use traditional methods but rather heuristic methods that derive their logic from the behavior of nature and natural processes. 
A genetic algorithm is a heuristic method whose logic is based on the biological process of evolution. 
This paper first describes the travelling salesman problem and the genetic algorithm, and then presents an application that uses the aforementioned problem for finding an optimal route for tourists, based on the PHP and JavaScript programming languages, and uses Laravel as an environment.
